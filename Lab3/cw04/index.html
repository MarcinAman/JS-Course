    1. To add new player fill the fields and click Accept. <br>
    2. If your time has passed just click "Next Round" <br>
    3. If You want to add new player just finish 3 of your rounds and click Accept <br>
    4. I suggest picking item number within 4-8 since next levels will have 2 and 4 times more elements <br>
    5. If you are stuck and dont have anything to collect just move your ball and new ones will appear <br> <br>
